### **Step 1: Build a Simple Retrieval System**
#### **Tasks for You:**
1. Research and choose a small dataset to use (e.g., Wikipedia dump, open-source datasets, or custom notes).
   - Download the dataset.
   - Preprocess the dataset (e.g., clean text, remove irrelevant data).
2. Set up **FAISS** or **ElasticSearch**:
   - Install the tool and initialize an environment.
   - Create an index for your dataset.
3. Build a basic retrieval pipeline:
   - Write a script to query the index and retrieve top-k relevant documents based on a user query.
4. Test the retrieval pipeline with basic queries (e.g., "What is Paris known for?").
   
#### **Tasks for Your Friend:**
1. Set up an environment for **Hugging Face Transformers** (or another LLM tool):
   - Install the Hugging Face library.
   - Load a lightweight model like GPT-2 or a smaller LLM.
2. Integrate retrieval with the LLM:
   - Create a function to combine retrieved documents with the LLM for generating answers.
   - Test with simple examples to ensure the retrieval informs the generated responses.
3. Validate the pipeline end-to-end:
   - Input → Retrieval → LLM Generation → Output.
   - Share results and discuss improvements.

### **Step 2: Add Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
#### **Tasks for You:**
1. Research pre-trained RAG pipelines or libraries for inspiration.
2. Write a function to preprocess retrieval outputs:
   - Format the retrieved documents into prompts for the LLM.
3. Experiment with combining retrieval snippets:
   - Create structured inputs for the LLM to ensure it generates contextual answers.

#### **Tasks for Your Friend:**
1. Test different LLMs for better performance:
   - Try a more advanced model like GPT-3 if feasible.
   - Compare results with the lightweight model (e.g., GPT-2).
2. Tune the system:
   - Optimize the retrieval mechanism (e.g., BM25 or vector embeddings).
   - Evaluate how the number of retrieved documents (k) affects the quality of generated answers.

### **Step 3: Design Adversarial Tests**
#### **Tasks for You:**
1. Create adversarial test cases manually:
   - Typos (e.g., "What iz the capitol of France?")
   - Ambiguous queries (e.g., "What is Paris known for?")
   - Misleading queries (e.g., "France's capital is New York, right?")
2. Write scripts to generate adversarial examples:
   - Use paraphrasing libraries like `parrot-paraphraser`.
   - Add random perturbations to text (e.g., swap letters, add noise).

#### **Tasks for Your Friend:**
1. Automate input generation:
   - Write a tool to batch-generate adversarial queries based on user input.
   - Use pre-trained models (e.g., T5) for semantic variations of queries.
2. Test the system against adversarial inputs:
   - Document system performance (retrieval and generation accuracy).
   - Share results with you for debugging.

### **Step 4: Evaluate System Robustness**
#### **Tasks for You:**
1. Define evaluation metrics:
   - Retrieval accuracy: Percentage of correct documents retrieved.
   - Generation accuracy: Coherence and correctness of the output.
   - Stress resilience: Number of adversarial queries causing incorrect responses.
2. Write evaluation scripts:
   - Measure retrieval accuracy by comparing retrieved documents with expected ones.
   - Score generation outputs manually or using a metric like BLEU.

#### **Tasks for Your Friend:**
1. Set up automated evaluation tools:
   - Use libraries like **Robustness Gym** to test adversarial resilience.
   - Implement a feedback loop to log system performance on different inputs.
2. Analyze system vulnerabilities:
   - Identify patterns in failures (e.g., frequent typos or ambiguous inputs causing issues).
   - Propose defense mechanisms based on findings.

---

### **Step 5: Add Defense Mechanisms**
#### **Tasks for You:**
1. Implement preprocessing steps:
   - Add fuzzy matching for typo correction (e.g., `fuzzywuzzy` library).
   - Normalize inputs (e.g., lowercase, remove extra spaces).
2. Improve retrieval robustness:
   - Experiment with reranking models (e.g., transformers for semantic scoring).
   - Test different retrieval algorithms like BM25.

#### **Tasks for Your Friend:**
1. Add confidence scoring to the LLM:
   - Penalize low-confidence answers or flag uncertain outputs.
   - Experiment with temperature settings in LLM generation.
2. Test the improved system:
   - Run it against the adversarial tests and compare performance with the initial system.

---

### **Step 6: Build a Dashboard**
#### **Tasks for You:**
1. Create a basic Streamlit app layout:
   - Input fields for user queries and adversarial examples.
   - Sections for retrieved documents and generated outputs.
2. Add visualization for evaluation metrics:
   - Display retrieval and generation accuracy.
   - Highlight incorrect outputs.

#### **Tasks for Your Friend:**
1. Integrate backend logic with the Streamlit app:
   - Connect the retrieval and generation pipeline to the app.
   - Ensure real-time query processing and visualization.
2. Add robustness insights:
   - Show a breakdown of adversarial queries and their effects on the system.

---

### **Step 7: Publish and Share**
#### **Tasks for You:**
1. Write a detailed report:
   - Document system design, adversarial findings, and implemented defenses.
   - Include visuals from the dashboard.
2. Create a GitHub repository:
   - Add clear README instructions for setup and usage.
   - Include examples of adversarial tests and system performance.

#### **Tasks for Your Friend:**
1. Prepare for community feedback:
   - Add issue templates to GitHub for bug reports and feature requests.
2. Promote the project:
   - Share it on platforms like LinkedIn, Reddit, or Hacker News.
   - Reach out to researchers or developers in the RAG space for feedback.

### Collaboration Tips:
- Use a shared GitHub repository to manage code and tasks.
- Schedule regular check-ins (e.g., weekly) to discuss progress and challenges.
- Document everything in a shared Google Doc or Notion workspace.
